1.9.1   Apr 27-28, 2006
-----

Better checking of validity of normalization method and normalization parameteres supplied to fitPLM, threestep etc.
quantiles.robust is now a supported normalization option (to match with normalize.quantiles.robust in the affy function)







very OLD CHANGELOG is below:


1.4.1
-----

Fix for bug in fitPLM when model is PM ~ -1 + samples + probes (ie default model) when there are probesets with only single probeset
Changed default setting of varcov from "all" to "none" in output.param in fitPLM ) this reduces memory over head.


1.4.2
-----

Boxplot on a exprSet by now uses range=0 by default


1.4.3
-----

Fix a potential gc() problem in threestep
Fix threestepPLM() so it works on Windows.
