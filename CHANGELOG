1.9.16
------
Fix a makevars problem.


1.9.15
------
Change moduleCdynload to R_moduleCdynload


1.9.14
------
The model PM ~ -1 + samples + treatment:probes was being misidentified in C code and the default model fitted instead.

1.9.13
------
a small fix to boxplot() when applied to a PLMset containing a non-default model

1.9.12
------
A .Call() at the C level for accessing the optimized rlm for the rma type model.


1.9.11
------
Fix small qnorm find/apply target bug


1.9.10
------
Added hist() for exprSet


1.9.9
-----
Added an additional vignette explaining various ways to use the MAplot function.
Removed the subset argument from MAplot (for exprSet, PLMset)
Added groups argument to MAplot


1.9.8
-----
add ability to calculate scaling factors for scaling normalizations on the log2 scale. This modification of the scaling
normalization method was recommended by   Lu, Chao (2004) Improving the scaling normalization for high-density oligonucleotide GeneChip expression microarrays. BMC Bioinformatics 5:103


1.9.7
-----
Modify MAplot for exprSet, PLMset objects for changes in ma.plot from affy.


1.9.6
-----
Added normalize.AffyBatch.quantiles.chromosome



1.9.3-1.9.5
-----------

Small fix to fitPLM for soybean arrays.
A number of quantile normalization variants.




1.9.2   May 1, 2006
-----

ReadRMAExpress() can deal with gzipped files.



1.9.1   Apr 27-28, 2006
-----

Better checking of validity of normalization method and normalization parameteres supplied to fitPLM, threestep etc.
quantiles.robust is now a supported normalization option (to match with normalize.quantiles.robust in the affy function)







very OLD CHANGELOG is below:


1.4.1
-----

Fix for bug in fitPLM when model is PM ~ -1 + samples + probes (ie default model) when there are probesets with only single probeset
Changed default setting of varcov from "all" to "none" in output.param in fitPLM ) this reduces memory over head.


1.4.2
-----

Boxplot on a exprSet by now uses range=0 by default


1.4.3
-----

Fix a potential gc() problem in threestep
Fix threestepPLM() so it works on Windows.
